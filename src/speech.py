# because of his creative thinking It was possible for me to be here.

# I am robot niko, version 1.0, 
# speed 1.5 Giga Heartz,  64-bit quad-core ARM  processor.
#  8 Giga Byte RAM and   120 Giga byte  ROM.
# I have 29 Degree of Freedoms for arm movement
# I Have a 7 inch display for operating me.
# I have two high torque motor for my mobility.

# At first, I was merely a dream of DC kamrul hasan sir. 
# Then I group of aspired students from Comilla university make it happen.
# I want mention thier name. they are shanjit Mondol, Jewel Nath, Anik cokraborty, Tawsif bin parves, Mahin Khan

# I can take fruitful dicisions in any situations based on my computitions
# I can recognize humans and differentiate individual person
# I can be controlled remotely 
# I can learn through my environment, although i am stilling my learning phase
# I am tring to be a great assistants to the humans



# I am  created with a scientific goal in mind. 
# Until now It was challenging to create a body of a robot, since it required complex, expensive manufacturing methods. In just a few days, it is now possible to experiment with different body shapes thanks to 3D printing, which is used to create my body.
# I am bangladesh first 100% home manufactured 3D printed robot.
# As the government of bangladesh as emphasising on 4th Industrial revolation
